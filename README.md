# X Days of ML Code

This is a modified version of the [100 Days of ML Code challenge](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code).

## The rules

* learn about ML every day
* make an entry in this document with the date as a header and in the body summarize what you've learned in as simple language as you can (as in the [Feynman technique](https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model))
* every day you do this, update your streak
* whenever possible, link a [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook with your learnings

## Motivation

Create an interactive library of your learning to
* motivate you by showing your progress (as in the [Seinfeld technique](https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
* have working code to reference when you forget things
* show to others to help them learn

## Notes

* prioritize **consistency** and **quality** over length of time spent (as in [deep work](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269805)). If you only have 5 minutes today, explore or review a single concept or even [API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/) of an ML-related library you use  
* choose a stack that has minimal setup and is easy for yourself and others to run and re-run. I've picked the tensorflow ecosystem and colab notebooks for myself
